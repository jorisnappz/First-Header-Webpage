# First-Header-Webpage
So I am learning to do HTML and CSS on my own. This project was adapted from a youtube project https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa9LTDR9ugU.
I have followed most of the steps twice and I've learned a lot, my only road block in this project is to get the bg and card images to display from inside my CSS code.
